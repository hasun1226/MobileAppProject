# Notes4U

## Iteration 02

 * Start date: Friday, November 4, 2016
 * End date: Monday, November 14, 2016

## Process

Prioritize the tasks and assign tasks to the team members.

#### Roles & responsibilities

* UI designer: Muser
   * Design the structure of User Interface and present it to the developers.
   * Design the graphical items to be used in the Application such as Application logo or background image.

* Back-end developers: Eddie, Kyle, Sunny
   * Develop the database which the Application will sit on.
   * Deploy, maintain the server that keeps the database and deliver the necessary information to the front-end developers.
   
* Front-end developers: Charga, James, Jimmy, Muser, Tyler
   * Develop the pages with Android Studio so that the Application handles the client-server interactions.
   * Coordinate the pages according to the layouts specified by the UI designer and the structure of database.
   
* Videographers: Muser, Sunny
   * Make a video demo with the working prototype of the Application.
   * Write out the necessary scripts and outline of the video so that the video using screen capture can present our Application’s working prototype efficiently.
   
* Notetaker: James
  * Take meeting notes for future reference.

#### Events

* "General Team Meeting" every Wednesday 11PM on Google Hangout
   * Discuss weekly progresses between the teams; front-end, back-end, UI designer. It allows the members to hold accountability to fulfilling their respective tasks.
   * Discuss the newly emerged tasks during the process or the tasks that are complete.

* "Back-end team meeting" every Wednesday 5PM in-person
   * Develop the databases for the Application, and while doing so, many of the back-end team members who are not familiar with the Ruby language can learn the language together.
   * After some discussion, the team members can go to the TA's office hour (7PM-8PM) if there are any questions that need to be answered.

* "Front-end team meeting" every Friday 6PM in-person
  * Develop the pages for the Application and link the pages with each other as each team member is responsible for each page.

* "Video making session"
   * Make a video that captures the Application process from user login to requesting for notes.

#### Artifacts

* To-do list using Trello
   * Prepared during the General Team meeting (every Wednesday on Google Hangout). Using Trello board because it has functions to set the priorities with the color and can easily move around the tasks from the to-do category to completed category and vice versa.
   * We would have prioritized the tasks over the urgency of the task (determined by whether or not the task prevents the team's progress), then the value of the task (aligned with the Product Goals). However, after laying out all the tasks with the highest urgency, we didn't have to compare the tasks with the same value because we had enough members to take on the tasks with the same urgency. 
   * During the development, if any issues blocking the progress are raised, that issue will be set with the highest priority (because of the urgency) and will be posted on each team's "To-do list" board in Trello. If there is an incomplete task at hand which was prioritized because it also hindered the team's progress, focus on the initial task and whoever finished their original task will deal with the newly raised issue (FIFO).
   
* Meeting notes prepared by James
  * It is a complement for the Trello board because meeting notes are more descriptive. It allows team members to refresh their memories on the tasks that they were assigned to.
  * Lets the team members to keep track of the changes in our priorities.

## Product

### Goals and tasks:

1. Develop Note requester’s (a.k.a. Slacker’s) portion of the Application.
   1. Now that we have the User Interface laid out, deploying the database server so that it can be accessible to the team is the top-priority because the front-end team cannot test their codes without the working database.
   2. Each of the front-end team members implements each page of the application: user login, posting a request for note, viewing the slacker's requests, and viewing the Not takers' profiles.
   3. Link individual pages with each other after all the pages are implemented.
   4. Having a logo and background image for the Application is solely for the aesthetics of the Application, so it has the lowest priority.

2. Make a video demo that captures the core features of the Application.
   1. Capture the necessary screens of the Application to present in the video so that the videographers can edit and make a script depending on the screenshots.
   2. Write a narrative script and make sure it fits into 3 minutes.
   3. Edit the video to make the video run in 3 minutes, and add the narrations and subtitles.


### Artifacts

* Databases for Users, Requests, Replies, Ratings on heroku
* Actual codes for Application pages that can be emulated on Android Studio.
  * Pages include pages for Login, Posting requests, Viewing their requests, Viewing the Note taker profiles.
* Video of the Application's functionalities which is to be submitted for Deliverable 2.
* Scripts of the video demo so that Videographers can make the video demo correspondingly.
