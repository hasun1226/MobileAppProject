# Notes4U

## Iteration 02

 * Start date: Friday, November 4, 2016
 * End date: Monday, November 14, 2016

## Process

Prioritize the tasks and assign tasks to the team members.

#### Roles & responsibilities

* UI designer: Muser
   * UI designer will design the User Interface in a way that clients can easily navigate through the Application and explain this information to the developers. 
   * UI designer is also in charge of designing the graphical items to be used in the Application such as Application logo or background image.
* Back-end developers: Eddie, Kyle, Sunny
   * Back-end developers are responsible for developing the database which the Application will run on.
   * Back-end developers will deploy the server that keeps the database and deliver the necesary information to the front-end developers.
* Front-end developers: Charga, James, Jimmy, Tyler
   * Front-end developers are responsible for developing the pages the clients will see and interact with. More specifically, the front-end developers will implement the methods that will handle the events that happen inside the Application on Android Studio.
   * Front-end developers will refer to the layout specified by the UI designer and coordinate the pages accordingly.
* Video shooters: Charga, Eddie, Sunny, Tyler
   * Once the team has a working prototype, the video shooters will make a video demo to present in deliverable 2.
   * Video shooters are responsible for deciding what kind of video to make, writing the necessary scripts, choosing appropriate location and time for the video.

#### Events

* "General Team Meeting" every Wednesday 11PM on Google Hangout
   * This meeting is intended to discuss progresses between teams; front-end, back-end, UI designer.
   * In order to discuss progresses, one should have a progress. We expect this meeting to motivate members to contribute every week.
* "Back-end team meeting" every Wednesday 5PM in-person
   * This meeting is intended to develop the databases for Application.
   * As not many of the back-end team members are familiar with the Ruby language, this meeting also serves as a learning session together.
   * After some discussion, the team members can go to the TA's office hour(7PM-8PM) if there are any questions that need to be answered.
* "Video making session"
   * This session will gather the responsible members to work on the video demo.

#### Artifacts

* To-do list using Trello
   * To-do list on Trello is prepared during the General Team meeting every Wednesday on Google Hangout by discussing what must be done at the moment.
   * After agreeing on the prioirities, if the task is a member-specific task, each member picks which task to work on. 
* Schedule using Google calendar
   * Front-end team's Midpoint checkup by November 9th, Final checkup by November 12th.

## Product

### Goals and tasks:

* Make a working prototype
   * Prioritize which features must be implemented, and which features can be ignored at the moment.
   * Deploying the database server so that it can be accessible to the team should be the priority because the front-end team cannot test their codes without the working database.
   * Once the database server is deployed, both team members must learn how to interact with the server through the Application.
* Make a video demo once we have a working prototype
   * Decide how the video will look like: 
     Option 1) Capture the screens and make a static video that will primarily rely on the narrations.
     Option 2) Use a camera to make a more dynamic video that may require actings.
   * Write a narrative/acting script for the video demo.

### Artifacts

* Build a semi-final version of the database and deploy it on heroku: http://notes4u.herokuapp.com/
* Actual codes for Application pages that are emulatable on Android Studio.
   * Pages include pages for Login, Posting requests, Viewing their requests, Viewing the Notetaker profiles
* Screenshots of the Application's functionalities which are to be included in the video demo in case they are necessary.
* Scripts and layouts of the video demo so that Video shooters can make the video demo correspondingly.
