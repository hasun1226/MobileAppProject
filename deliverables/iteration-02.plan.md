# Notes4U

## Iteration 02

 * Start date: Friday, November 4, 2016
 * End date: Monday, November 14, 2016

## Process

Prioritize the tasks and assign tasks to the team members.

#### Roles & responsibilities

* UI designer: Muser
   * Design the structure of User Interface and present it to the developers.
   * Design the graphical items to be used in the Application such as Application logo or background image.

* Back-end developers: Eddie, Kyle, Sunny
   * Develop the database which the Application will sit on.
   * Deploy, maintain the server that keeps the database and deliver the necessary information to the front-end developers.
   
* Front-end developers: Charga, James, Jimmy, Muser, Tyler
   * Develop the pages with Android Studio so that the Application handles the client-server interactions.
   * Coordinate the pages according to the layouts specified by the UI designer and the structure of database.
   
* Videographers: Charga, Eddie, Sunny, Tyler
   * Make a video demo with the working prototype of the Application.
   * Write out the necessary scripts and outline of the video so that the video using screen capture can present our Application’s working prototype efficiently.

#### Events

* "General Team Meeting" every Wednesday 11PM on Google Hangout
   * Discuss weekly progresses between the teams; front-end, back-end, UI designer. It allows the members to hold accountability to fulfilling their respective tasks.
   * Discuss the newly emerged tasks during the process or the tasks that are complete.

* "Back-end team meeting" every Wednesday 5PM in-person
   * Develop the databases for the Application, and while doing so, many of the back-end team members who are not familiar with the Ruby language can learn the language together.
   * After some discussion, the team members can go to the TA's office hour (7PM-8PM) if there are any questions that need to be answered.

* "Front-end team meeting" every Friday 6PM in-person
  * Develop the pages for the Application and link the pages with each other as each team member is responsible for each page.

* "Video making session"
   * Make a video that captures the Application process from user login to note request to receiving note taker’s confirmation.

#### Artifacts

* To-do list using Trello
   * Prepared during the General Team meeting (every Wednesday on Google Hangout) by discussing what must be done at the moment in order to move on to the next stage.
   * After agreeing on the priorities, each member picks which task to work on if the task is a member-specific task.
 
* Schedule using Google calendar
   * Keep track of the deadlines and send push alarms when the deadline is approaching.

## Product

### Goals and tasks:

1. Develop Note requester’s (a.k.a. Slacker’s) portion of the Application
   1. Now that we have the User Interface laid out, deploying the database server so that it can be accessible to the team is the top-priority because the front-end team cannot test their codes without the working database.
   2. Core features that the front-end team will implement are user login, posting a request for the note, viewing the Note takers’ profiles, and the handshakes between the Slacker and Note taker.
   3. Having a logo and background image for the Application is solely for the aesthetics of the Application, so it is the least priority.

2. Make a video demo that captures the core features of the Application
   1. Capture the necessary screens of the Application to present in the video so that the videographers can edit and make a script depending on the screenshots.
   2. Write a narrative script and make sure it fits into 3 minutes.
   3. Edit the video if editing is considered necessary or some narrations and screens are considered to be unnecessary.


### Artifacts

* Databases for Users, Requests, Replies, Ratings on heroku: http://notes4u.herokuapp.com/
* Actual codes for Application pages that can be emulated on Android Studio.
  * Pages include pages for Login, Posting requests, Viewing their requests, Viewing the Note taker profiles.
* Screenshots of the Application's functionalities which are to be included in the video demo.
* Scripts and layouts of the video demo so that Videographers can make the video demo correspondingly.
