## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 14, 2016
 * Where: BA1200 in-person

## Process - Reflection

Takeaways after going into the actual development.

Decisions turned out well:

 1. Implementing and focusing on the Note requester's (a.k.a. Slacker's) portion of the application in order to include in Deliverable 2. Aside from the fact that the Slacker is the starting point of the application's usage, the development and task assignment were a lot easier by narrowing down the scope to the Slackers which led the team to complete the working prototype and the video in time.
 2. Using Ruby to develop the databse because the database was completed very quickly thanks to the handiness of the language (Deployed on heroku in the first week of November).
 3. Having a weekly general and team-based meeting because it got the team members to work on the application by asking for progresses and working on the project together in-person. It also allowed the team to finally have a get-together and members got less awkward with each other.
 4. Having a separate Trello board to keep track of the tasks that needs to be done. This was especially helpful when the team was developing the products because a group of a big size is supposedly hard to coordinate and monitor. However, this was not a big problem thanks to the Trello board letting each team know what they need to do and having each member to take charge of the task if nobody is in charge of it.

 * Back-end Team's To-d- List: https://trello.com/b/fpJuuHce/backend-tasks
 5. Using the screencapture for the video demo because no actings are required, and most of our team members are terrible actors.

Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:

 1. Although back-end team can get the job done and members are learning the Ruby on rails language, the team is highly reliant on sole member when tasks get too complicated.
 2. We were not able to have a video making session because of coordination problem. As a result, the videographers are reduced down to two members from initial four members but the members still had to work individually.

We are planning to make the following change(s) to our process:

 1. We need to have a better coordination scheme moving into the hardest part of the development, especially when the school works will start to pour down on team members. This concern is also signaled by the second decision that did not turn out very well.


## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 1. Actual codes for Application pages that can be emulated on Android Studio: [Notes4U directory](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2016/project-team-19/tree/master/Notes4U).
 2. Databases for Users, Requests, Replies on heroku: http://notes4u.herokuapp.com/
 3. Video demo.
 4. Scripts of the video demo.
 5. [Notes4U logo](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2016/project-team-19/blob/master/Notes4U/app/src/main/res/drawable/logo2.png).

Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 1. A page for posting requests is not quite finished yet because of the connection error to the database. We are still trying to figure out what the problem is even after having four members of the team working on it.
 2. This was not part of the task in Iteration-plan, but back-end team is trying to figure out how to make the routing for nested resources to work. This has turned out to be difficult because majority of the back-end team members are not quite proficient in Ruby on rails language.


Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * We need more effective and efficient ways to make decisions and to get results.
 * Increased responsibility on Front-end team.
