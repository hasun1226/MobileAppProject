## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Saturday, October 15, 2016
 * Where: Gerstein 2108

## Process - Reflection

Decisions turned out well:

 * Unanimous agreement on Product Idea
    * Adopted an agile Dot Voting process to choose a product idea
    * Documented on Trello: https://trello.com/b/kB7JG8RA/iteration-1-meeting-notes
 * Deciding to do Google Hangouts Meetings on a weekly frequency
    * Enabled more flexibiity for everyone's schedule
    * Slack conversation at team23fam.slack.com re: meeting times and punctuality
 * Using Trello to store meeting proceedings
    * Significantly reduces the overhead of keeping artifacts for our meetings
    * Trello board link: https://trello.com/team19104 


Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:

 * Deciding to have Release Planning before having an idea of what a typical user journey is
    * Spent a meeting working on the Workflow.png when we wanted to complete the Product Backlog.
 * Attempting to assign roles and responsibilities before having an idea of how we would go about implementing the application
    * Our initial attempt at deciding on roles and responsibilities in the first meeting:
        * https://trello.com/b/kB7JG8RA/iteration-1-meeting-notes
    * Our second attempt:
        * https://trello.com/b/08nEarXy/iteration-2-meeting-notes

We are not currently planning to make any changes to our process.

## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * Workflow Diagram (planned)
    * In `../artifacts/Workflow.png`
 * Roles and Responsibilities assigned (planned)
    * https://trello.com/b/kB7JG8RA/iteration-1-meeting-notes
 * Deliverables completed (planned)
    * You're reading them.
 * Product prototype mock-ups
    * In `../artifacts/mockups.jpg` 

Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Product Backlog
    * Realized that we had misalignment on what the typical user journey was, so we had to hash that our before we could define a workflow.
    * The Workflow Diagram was the main blocker, so now that that's done we can create this.

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Figure out what the thinnest vertical slice of functionality we can implement is so we can get a working prototype up as soon as possible.
 * Prioritize the Product Backlog weekly, so that we are always aware of whether or not we are on track to completing the final product.
