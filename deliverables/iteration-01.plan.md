 * : 

#### Events

Please describe the meetings you planning to have:
 * Every Wednesday 11PM on Google Hangout

#### Artifacts

Please describe the artifacts that you will produce in order to organize and keep track of your team's progress.       
For example:
 * To-do lists, burndown chart, schedule, etc.
 * If you include charts/diagrams, make sure to explain what they represent.
 * If you're maintaining a to-do list, make sure to mention which tool you're using, how you are prioritizing items and how items get assigned to team members.


## Product

Goals and tasks:

 * Decide on the product idea
 * Decide the roles and responsibilities
 * 

Artifacts

 * Describe the artifacts (diagrams, interactive mock-ups, wireframes, actual code, etc.)
   that you are planning to produce by the end of (and during) this iteration.
 * Be precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
