# Notes4U/Team19

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Notes4U is a mobile application that serves the needs for obtaining notes for a specified lecture. 
When a student inevitably misses a lecture they are left with a gap in their learning for that class and may fall behind. 
It is in their best interests to catch up and obtain the notes for the missed lecture. With Notes4U he/she can request 
help from another student to take the notes in place of the requester. It is important to note that Notes4U is not a 
replacement for course attendance/participation. Notes4U strictly concerns itself with written notes and not audio
recordings.

Obtaining notes that are relevant to the lecture missed has an advantage over looking at existing notes uploaded 
previously by students for different years/lecture sessions/looking at concept on wikipedia/etc. Firstly, it will
require the student less time and research to cover the material on the missed topic. Secondly, notes from previous years
might have less information not covered by the course lecturer. Students might miss important key points in understanding
the concept. Having notes taken realtime allows the students to request note takers to note down important points such as 
information regarding an upcoming midterm or exam.  

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

- UofT students aged 17+ who have to skip class for various reasons (sickness, work, urgent deadlines,unforseen events)

- Students who are looking to make an extra bit of income on the side in their free time. (Note Takers)

- Personas: Jack is a 1st year student in the class BIO 120 without any friends in this class, he has lectures every Monday morning at 9. 
Jack want to go to this party Sunday night and he knows that he's probably not going to be in shape for class. He needs the lecture 
notes though because Professor Thompson refuses to post any of his notes. Although Jack hates the prof but he needs to pass the midterm coming 
up and Thompson’s test are so ridiculously hard.(40 average like…...) He needs the notes but he has no friends in his class 
(He spent too much time partying with his dorm-mates.) He decided he needs someone in the class to take his notes for him.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem?

Students who get sick often or have obligations during lecture times will ask for notes and most of them are asking through discussion boards such as piazza. 
However, asking for a notes on piazza is very slow without incentives. Notes4U filters out the students who are available at a certain time slot and 
capable of taking understandable notes, making the process of offering and receiving the notes much faster. 

Currently, there are only notes repositories that offer the notes from the past lectures. 
The past lectures may not cover the same materials as the current lectures or 
the professor could have been changed in the current offering. In such cases, Jack will not 
be content with buying the notes from the past. 

Users would choose to use this product if they are unable to attend a lecture for a day, due to sickness. 
Many profs (especially within the arts faculty) prefer to write notes on the blackboard and through speech, and so
some notes can only be taken by hand.
Many notes available on sites are incomplete sometimes they don’t provide the slides for that lecture.
Notes from previous years may not match the teaching style of the professor for that lecture.

There is currently no other service that offers a personalized note-taking service experience in the market currently
